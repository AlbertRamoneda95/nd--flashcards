# “FlashCard” Project

  

This is the third and final project assessment project for Udacity's React-Redux course, which is a part of the React Nanodegree program

  

This last project consists on a mobile flashcard app developed using react native and expo
  

In this app, users are able to generate different decks containing multiple questions in order to remind them of important topics. Once a deck with one or multiple questions is created, users can also test their memory by doing a quiz with every question contained in the deck.
  

App data is managed and consumed via AsyncStorage, so data containing deck, questions and quiz info will be consumed in a stored asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app.
